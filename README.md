## NOYALY: Stress Monitoring App

### 1. Overview
This project is built in fulfillment of the requirements for the module ET0529: Mobile Application Development CA3. It aims to develop a **Stress Monitoring App** designed to help users check in with their stress levels, learn about stress, and reflect on their well-being over time. It is built around the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), a widely used research-based questionnaire for measuring perceived stress.

> ⚠️ Noyaly is not a medical or diagnostic tool. It is intended for self-reflection and stress awareness only.
